# MASTER
This is the final project of team **Money is All You Need** for Brown CSCI1470 Deep Learning in Spring 2025. 
We re-implemented the AAAI-2024 paper: **MASTER: Market-Guided Stock Transformer for Stock Price Forecasting** by Li et al. 2024 and predicted U.S. stock prices by training on the Global Factor Dataset.

## Current Progress
- We have re-implemented the paper in Tensorflow and preprocessed the Global Factor Dataset.
- We have trained our model on this dataset and collected metrics to evaluate its performances.
- We have documented our model, challenges, and our reflection.

## Future works
- We plan to build a multimodal model that is able to incorporate text data on the financial markets and improve the performance.
